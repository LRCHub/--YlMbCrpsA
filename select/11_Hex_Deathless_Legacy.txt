Take a Lead tablet
Write the curse
Fold it seven times
Pierce it with a nail

Inhale, visualize what's to come
How your victim will succumb
By a violently dead man's tomb
You aim your victim's doom

Berebescu
I curse your mind and lungs
Your liver and words mixed up
Your memory, fucked up

Bazagra
I curse your thoughts and perception
Let that be your last lesson
Unable to think. So be it
Hex
My Hex

By a damned tomb
Dig a small hole
Put the fetish in
Run away in the dark

Make sure nobody sees your shadow
Slither fiercely, you're unbowed
Revenge is all I'm looking for
Charon hear my call

Berebescu
I curse your mind and lungs
Your liver and words mixed up
Your memory, fucked up

Bazagra
I curse your thoughts and perception
Let that be your last lesson
Unable to think. So be it
Hex
My Hex

[00:50.28] Two years
[00:54.73] In your heart
[00:59.23] One moment of doubt
[01:08.73] 
[01:09.28] Two lives
[01:11.97] Torn apart
[01:18.32] One second from now
[01:27.82] 
[01:51.67] Held him
[01:54.32] In your arms
[02:01.66] Your fever subside
[02:11.50] Always safe from harm
[02:20.57] Kept demons inside
[02:29.57] 
[04:43.13] Still you always start runnin'
[04:52.16] Touch the light
[04:54.06] From the moon
[05:02.11] Some way mother cried
[05:12.09] Left us space here

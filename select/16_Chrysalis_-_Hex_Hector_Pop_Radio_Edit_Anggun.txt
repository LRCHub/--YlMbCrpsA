Like a tiger
Know how to lure you with my feline's touch
A trouble spider
Can make a trap to catch the one I want
But fine as a white dove
I'd do anything for the one I love
To get that one kiss
I'll wait patiently like a chrysalis

Just remember
That I can be strong and tender
Just remember and beware

C/o

Cause I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie like you do
Oh yes
I know the way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts
Like you do

Satisfy me
Want you to treat me like I'm a queen bee
The woman in me
Just like a wild horse I need to run free
Like a butterfly
I can be sweet and very infantile
A viper, a cobra
I also can be viciously unkind
Just remember that I can be strong and tender
Just remember and beware

C/o

Cause I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie
Like you do
Oh yes I know

The way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts
Like you do

I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie
Like you do
Oh yes I know
The way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts
Like you do

(Bridge)

I know
Just remember
I can do what you do
I know
Just remember
And beware

I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie
Like you do
Oh yes I know
The way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie
Like you do

Oh yes I know
The way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts
Like you do

Cause I know
The way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie
Like you do
Oh yes I know
The way to break your heart...

I put a hex on your mind, you put a bless on my line
I put a hex on your mind, you put a bless on my line
You're my river, liquid, and silver
I put a check on your name, take more than half of your pay
One second of your time for all of mine
Feelings again, blue night dreaming again
Watching me, tryna copy me and my fam
Fuck with SG and the gang, Louis V locks in my chain
I'ma reach down in the lake, foreign money coming in
I don't trust you or your friend, I don't wanna go back again
Money's frozen in my hand, it's frozen
You don't tell me everything, just tell me anything
Broken glass in my hands, you sell me anything
I walk a mile for your smile, it's embarrassing
I put bleach in my drink, acid in my eyes, and shit
I'm feeling paranoid, like the walls is closing in
Feel like I'm made of tin, lost my heart, it went missing
Feel like I'm made of tin, lost my heart, I went missing
Feels like I'm made of tin, lost my heart, it went missing
Drain Gang, it's a gathering
Dripping off my wedding ring, better than I've ever been
Lock eyes with a beautiful girl and she's not scared of him
I can be your skeleton, you can be my vitamin
Blade slip out my hand and I bleed out
Thaiboy in New York, bring the weed out
Trashstar at the top in the hideout
Drain Gang got the knife like a boy scout
I put a hex on your mind, you put a bless on my line
You're my river, liquid, and silver
I put a check on your name, take more than half of your pay
One second of your time for all of mine
